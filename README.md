# Versioned Documentation

## Introduction

Versioned is a content backend (i.e. a headless CMS) that is available both
as [a managed service](https://www.versioned.io) and as [open source software on Github](https://github.com/versioned-cms). The Versioned system is made up of a REST API and an admin UI and is built on the tech stack [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

The value proposition of a content backend like Versioned is that it provides a cost efficient and fast way to manage database content in a single repository and to deliver it via an API to your websites and applications and any other clients (or systems) that need it. Building such a system from scratch takes months of developer time but with Versioned you can be up and running and serving your content in hours.
